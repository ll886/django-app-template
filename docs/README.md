# Introduction

This style guide defines a pattern for Django [apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/applications/#module-django.apps).

The main goals of this pattern are:

1. Organization
2. Separation of concerns
3. Defining boundaries and layers
4. Easier testing

This app template serves as a good base for your Django apps. You can either follow this guide strictly or use it as inspiration
and adjust to fit your situation.
